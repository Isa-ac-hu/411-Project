IDEA 2: True Music Shuffle - Using Spotify and Apple Music (or other music application), we import a playlist and implement an actual shuffle. True Shuffle is different from the regular shuffle that those music applications already have, which isn’t actually random. The shuffle takes into account the last played song and then plays one that’s similar or aligns most with what the user mostly listens to. True Shuffle doesn’t do that, it truely randomizes the selection, only really taking into account that a song being played doesn’t repeat before having gone through the entire playlist first, or not for a period of time since it’s been last played.
